Proverbs 16:18</b><br><br>At home, Haman gathered his family and friends and began to boast about his importance to the king and how he was now the chief officer.  'Except for the king, I was the only one invited to the queen's banquet,' he bragged.  'And tomorrow, I'm invited to another banquet the queen is putting on.  Just me and the king!'  Then Haman's face darkened as he remembered Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.  He told his wife and friends how angry he was. <br><br>'Build a gallows and ask the king to order that Mordecai be hanged on it,' his wife and friends said.  Haman thought that was a great idea, so he had somebody build the gallows - 50 feet high, just outside Haman's front door. <br><br>That night, the king could not sleep.  He ordered a servant to read to him from the history records.  What do you think the servant read?  That's right!  He read about Mordecai's report which had saved the king's life.  'What reward did Mordecai receive?' the king asked.  There was no record of any reward.  By now it was morning.  Haman arrived in the court.  'Bring him here,' the king said.  'I'll ask him what should be done for the man whom the king wants to honor.' <br><br><i>Prayer:  Dear Lord, please keep me from being proud and haughty.  Amen.</i>"

Psalm 33:12</b><br><br>Haman was very happy to be called into the king's room.  When the king asked his advice about how to honor somebody the king wants to reward, Haman thought, 'He must be talking about me.'  Haman probably imagined just how it would feel as he said, 'Give such a man clothing the king has worn; and one of the king's own horses with a royal crest on its head.  Let the man sit on the horse and let somebody lead him through the city crying out, 'This man is honored by the king.'' <br><br>What a shock it must have been for Haman when the king commanded him, 'You lead the horse.  You make the announcement.  You do everything you just said.  Do it for Mordecai the Jew.  Go on.  Do it now!' <br><br>So Haman took the clothes and the horse, dressed Mordecai and led him on horseback through the city.  Haman had to cry out, 'This man is honored by the king.'  When he was finished, Haman went home, sad and angry. <br><br>It didn't help when his friends and wife told him, 'You won't win against Mordecai because he is a Jew.'  Perhaps these people knew that God always stood up for His own people.  As they talked, the king's servants came to take Haman to the queen's banquet.  Together, they passed the 50 feet high gallows. <br><br><i>Prayer: Dear Lord, thank You for blessing and watching over Your chosen people.  Amen.</i>"

The king may have first thought that this was some kind of joke - but it wasn't.  When he saw that Esther was serious, he demanded, ' Who would dare to even think of such a thing?' <br><br>'The enemy is Haman,' Queen Esther replied.  Maybe she had a copy of the new law which ordered killing all the Jews in the kingdom.  Maybe she showed it to the king and pointed to Haman.  However it happened, all of a sudden Haman was terrified.  He could see the king was angry.  In fact, the king was so angry that he left the room and went into the garden. <br><br>In the banquet room, Haman kneeled before Queen Esther, begging for his life.  The king returned to find Haman collapsed across Esther's couch.  The king was so furious, he said, 'Is this man trying to hurt the queen even while I'm here?' <br><br>The king's servants covered Haman's face, led him to the gallows he had built for Mordecai, and hanged him.

But the terrible law he had invented was still there.  The king had signed it - there was no way to 'unsign' it.  Queen Esther wept and begged the king to find a way of stopping her people from being killed.  The king, who had already given all of Haman's money and land to the queen, wanted to help.  But it seems he couldn't think of a way to do so.  He told Esther and her uncle Mordecai, 'You write a law about the Jews - whatever you want to write - and I'll sign it.'<br><br>Mordecai, who was now second only to the king, knew what to do.  He wrote a law which was sent out all over the world in one hundred and twenty-seven languages.  This new law allowed  the Jews who were in every city to band together and protect their lives.  The law gave them the right to fight back if anybody tried to harm them or their children.<br><br>All across the Empire, Jewish people rejoiced.  Wherever the new law was read out, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a holiday.  A lot of people who were not Jewish joined them. <br><br>On the thirteenth day of the Jewish month called Adar (usually March in today's calendar) Mordecai's law came into effect.  Instead of the enemies of the Jews overpowering them, the Jews were able to survive.  They were safe - because Queen Esther trusted and obeyed God. <br><br>The fourteenth day of Adar became a day of feasting and gladness - Purim, a holiday that Jewish people have kept through the centuries and celebrate to this day. <br><br><i>Prayer: Dear Lord, thank You that You are the strength of Your people.
